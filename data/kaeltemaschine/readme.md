Hi Braulio,
 
Additionally here some more informations on the API. And following this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/12jn9V6wUAezWU3vfG2GBS_KE6APYLZ0R/view?usp=sharing
you can find an example of 12Hz raw data (from a Gassmann KÃ¤ltemachine), we can deliver with our sensors.
 
Best Regards
Gino
