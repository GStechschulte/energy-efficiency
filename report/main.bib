This paper will outline a preliminary methodology for determining when building operation parameters have changed, attempt to identify them, and suggest solutions, given a top-down monitoring methodology combined with a bottom-up fault diagnostics approach. The approach in this paper will combine the use of free open-source graphical analytic tools with whole building interval energy consumption data for the development of control charts. This technique leverages advancements in computing and smart grid technology along with industrial process quality control methods to facilitate fault detection and diagnostics in commercial buildings. This technique will be discussed, from technical requirements to implementation, with special attention paid to the progress of a test case deployment.},

	abstract = {Most manufacturing and process industries require compressed air to such an extent that in Europe, for instance, about 10\% of the total electrical energy consumption of industries is due to compressed air systems ({CAS}). However, energy efficiency in compressed air production and handling is often ignored or underestimated, mainly because of the lack of awareness about its energy consumption, caused by the absence of proper measurements on {CAS} in most industrial plants. Therefore, any effective energy saving intervention on generation, distribution and transformation of compressed air requires proper energy information management. In this paper we demonstrate the importance of monitoring and controlling energy performance in compressed air generation and use, to enable energy saving practices, to enhance the outcomes of energy management projects, and to obtain additional benefits for non-energy-related activities, such as operations, maintenance management and energy accounting. In particular, we propose a novel methodology based on measured data, and baseline definition through statistical modelling and control charts. The proposed methodology is tested on a real compressed air system of a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in order to verify its effectiveness and applicability.},

	abstract = {A key goal of transactive energy systems is to facilitate scalable adoption of intermittent and distributed resources in grid modernization and improve overall operational efficiency of the electric grid. Given that buildings are 70\% of the load on today’s grid, it is critical to better understand electric load shapes, how to change them, and how to improve energy efficiency in buildings. Transactive energy systems must be able to transmit information about and facilitate changes in electric loads. A transactive system should provide an application platform that providesaccess to building data, allows analyses of energy transactions, and generates actionable information for building systems and operators, occupants, owners, and service providers.  Wepresent four use cases for a transactive energy network that show that in addition to the societal and economic benefits provided by real-time energy transactions, there are large benefits that are enabled by the transactive system infrastructure. We show that energy and outside temperature data provide useful information for evaluating electric loads in many buildings.  We also present an example of the use of proxy occupancy data that help demonstrate the value that such data provide in identifying operational performance issues},

	abstract = {The energy industry is striving for cost-efficient production with low emissions. The efficiency of energy conversion processes is one of the most important factors affecting the path to such a goal. This paper provides a framework for the monitoring of steam boiler operation in power stations. The framework is based on the use of historical process data as a reference for real-time operation. The actual boiler efficiency is monitored together with its expected efficiency, which is an estimate of the highest historical efficiency in the corresponding process state, based on a data-driven model. In the presented approach, the process state is defined on the basis of variables that have the strongest correlation with boiler efficiency according to information-theoretic variable ranking. Boiler performance is monitored using a statistical process control chart for the difference between the expected and actual efficiencies. The framework was tested using data from a circulating fluidised bed boiler and from a corner-fired boiler. The results revealed that the strongest correlations between process variables and boiler efficiency are substantially consistent in both cases. Moreover, the framework provides a novel measure for boiler performance enhancement.},
