This appendix contains figures that do not flow and or belong in the main body of the thesis. Figure \ref{fig:fig18} is the result of a Gaussian Process model fit and predictions for the main terminal. Figure \ref{fig:fig19} is the production week time series for the R707LV printer.

\caption{Interpolation and extrapolation for the main terminal GP model at a $30$ minute time aggregation. The demand for energy during the afternoon on Friday tapered off much quicker than what the baseline model had predicted and thus is the reason for the poor evaluation metrics.}
