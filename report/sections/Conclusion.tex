\subsection{Summary of Main Results}

Using the metering data provided by CLEMAP, an energy consumption benchmark is established using a reporting period that represents the ``best operating conditions" for a piece of equipment and where the residuals fluctuate around a mean of zero. From there, using the posterior predictive distribution and SPC charts, the EE is monitored and analyzed to identify when a machine is deviating away from the expected behavior. Thus, not only is a probabilistic energy baseline model useful in benchmarking energy consumption, but it also provides value to the client in identifying a significant deviation in EE. As a proof of concept, an example was shown using the paper disposal machine. Using the methods proposed, the model and SPC charts identified a large decrease in energy consumption. When these charts were presented to the production leader and technician of CLEMAP's client, they had stated they were not too sure what could have caused such a significant decrease, but it could be related to the R707LV, XL106, or steel folding machine. Furthermore, when presented the time series plots, they were surprised that the machine was cycling over night, when in fact the machine should not be consuming energy.

For proof of feasibility, it was determined that a batch setting was the most cost effective way of developing the models. In a batch setting, the entire dataset $D$ is available before training starts. Therefore, this allowed CLEMAP to give us a ``data dump" which doesn't incur additional costs for the company in the form of increased technical support and compute. However, it is possible with CLEMAP's \ac{API} to develop the model in an online setting, i.e., the data arrives sequentially in an unbounded stream. Though, this type of modeling is more demanding in regard to compute power, API requests, and technical skillsets—all resulting in additional costs for CLEMAP. Subsequently, with several models having been developed for the proposed machines, a docker container is created in preparation for deployment on CLEMAP's infrastructure. This container represents the \textit{inference} phase, and allows CLEMAP to incorporate and or develop this container into their production environment as needed. 

\subsection{Comparisons and Differences to Current Research and Work in Industry}

In this thesis, methodologies currently in use in the industry were utilized and built on top of. Here, the comparisons and differences are outlined. Referring to \hyperlink{section.2}{Section 2}, additional data is often used to improve the quality of the model and to provide additional insights into the quantification of EE and PDD. Data is typically compiled through two forms: (1) additional sensors, and (2) non-sensor based. Per the meeting with CLEMAP's client on 12.05.2022, they have data on the week ahead production schedule and are interested in using this data—combined with the energy data—to produce productivity metrics. Likewise, this production data could be used as an input, in addition to the time input, in the GP to improve the quality of the energy baseline model. In doing so, the forecasted energy consumption would also be correlated with the expected produced goods. In \cite{HIPE} \cite{boiler} \cite{gas-turbine-faults}, data related to harmonic oscillations was also collected and used to quantify its relationship with energy consumption and deviations in EE. The probabilistic methods used in this thesis allows for the communication of uncertainty in the SPC charts and forecasted energy consumption using the posterior predictive distribution. Whereas in the literature, single point predictions are used which doesn't allow for a range of plausible values. 

\subsection{Applicability of Methods and Research to Other Contexts Within Industry 4.0}

In this thesis, benchmarking energy consumption and identifying deviations using an energy baseline model is a scalable framework that can be adapted to different machines in an industrial setting (as shown in \hyperlink{section.2}{Section 2} and with the analysis on the HIPE data). The specific method chosen for modeling in this thesis, namely Gaussian Processes, is also a powerful non-parametric way for modeling non-linear time series. The construction of kernels allows one to model a wide variety of processes. However, GPs have difficulty in extrapolating when the underlying physical process of a machine displays less evidence of a component(s) of a time series \hyperlink{subsection.3.2}{Section 3.2}. For example, the R707LV printer in Figure \ref{fig:fig19} of the appendix displays less evidence of cyclical patterns. Likewise, the underlying function has ``kinks" which is very difficult to model as most kernels generate smooth functions. Therefore, when the time series displays abrupt changes, i.e., kinks or discontinuities in the underlying function, GPs with the standard kernels presented in this thesis perform poorly in extrapolation. 

\subsection{Next Steps}

Next steps include leveraging the insights (incorporating production data) from the meeting on 12.05.2022 with CLEMAP's client to provide additional value to monitoring EE and performing PDD. Likewise, defining productivity metrics using the baseline model could be calculated. For example, using the expected amount of produced goods for the next production week, an energy consumption forecast could then be computed using the amount of produced goods as a covariate. From there, productivity metrics could be forecasted such as energy consumed per unit of produced good (output). Then, following the same framework in the thesis, the difference between the forecasted and actual value could be monitored to identify at which process or machine the productivity metric is deviating from the forecast. Another area of improvement is to define a longer reporting period than four production days. The current four days may include some latent variable that is not accounted for, and therefore it is suggested to use a longer time series to train the GP model to analyze potentially different consumption profiles as in \cite{cas}.
