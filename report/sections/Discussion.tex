\subsection{Evaluating Machine Energy Efficiency and Performance using Control Charts}

In this section, it is discussed on how to use the energy baseline model to identify a benchmark reporting period, monitor EE and perform PDD. Building off of \cite{oakland_statistical_2008}, the choice of the benchmark reporting period in which the model is trained on is crucial as it provides a reference to which predictions are compared to. In \cite{cas}, the authors trained their MLR on a period of one year and plotted the instantaneous and cumulative residuals. These two SPC charts allowed the authors to analyze periods of \textit{best} CAS performance indicated by the residuals fluctuating around a mean of zero. Ultimately, the baseline model was then retrained on a time period of $36$ days representing the \textit{best} performance. Here, an example of a workflow for choosing the benchmark reporting period for the paper disposal machine is given.

Using the kernel design according to the evaluation metrics in \hyperlink{table.3}{Table 3}, the model is trained on $10$ minute aggregated data from October $11^{th}$ until October $15^{th}$. In \hyperlink{figure.14}{Figure 14}, the top plot visualizes the instantaneous residuals of the in sample model fit. i.e., the difference of the predictions of the baseline model with the actual values of the benchmark reporting period. The bottom plot visualizes the cumulative residuals of the in sample fit. 

Where the SPC charts developed in this thesis differ from that in the literature and in industry is that the energy baseline model is a probabilistic model, and therefore, we have access to the uncertainty in our predictions. Where current SPC charts only take into account the point predictions and standard deviation of residuals to define UCL and LCL (as described in \hyperlink{subsection.2.3}{Section 2.3}), our proposed SPC charts utilizes the posterior distribution to define the control limits. Namely, by using the $95\%$ PI, a probabilistic approach can be used to determine the statistical significance of deviations in performance and change in EE over time. 

A red point in the top plot indicates that, at that time point $t$, the actual value was greater than $2 \sigma$ away from the mean prediction $\hat{\mu}_t$ and vice versa. Looking back at the time series plot in \hyperlink{figure.10}{Figure 10}, one can identify these outlier points. Then, in the CuSum plot, MA trend lines ($1$hr and $6$hr) are plotted to aid the identification of a benchmark reporting period. It can be seen that the slope of the residuals slightly increases until about the end of the day on October $12^{th}$, then is constant, and finally shows a slight decrease. However, in both charts, the mean of the residuals fluctuates around the zero bound, and thus the justification as using these four days for the benchmark reporting period is justified.

With a benchmark reporting period now chosen, predictions for every $10$ minutes for the next $24$ hours are computed. The same SPC charts are then visualized in \hyperlink{figure.15}{Figure 15} as a hypothetical example to what the operators / production leaders may receive in a real production environment. In the top chart, around 10:30a.m the paper disposal machine was consuming much less energy than what was deemed plausible by the GP model. Indicated by the red dots, these values lie in succession and are $2\sigma$ away from the expected value. Subsequently, there is a reversion back to what seems to be the nominal operating conditions. The CuSum plot, indicated by the change in slope starting at about 8:30a.m until 11:45a.m, identifies this deviation as a large deviation in machine energy consumption. With the SPC charts having identified a change in EE as a result of a significant decrease in energy consumption, the original time series is plotted again in \hyperlink{figure.16}{Figure 16}. Indeed, indicated by the red shading, there was a significant decrease in energy consumption. 

Furthermore, when a change in EE is identified, the time, machine, actual value, and degree of deviation (indicated by the z-score; how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean) is logged in a database where a historical registry of machine deviations can be built. Operations and maintenance teams can analyze this table to discuss each event, and the more data that is predicted and compared to the benchmark, the more valuable the registry becomes. For example, \hyperlink{figure.17}{Figure 17} refers to the deviations that occurred on 15.10.2021, the type of machine, and the degree of deviation. To communicate z-scores to a non-technical audience, a color coding scheme is used where red indicates the actual value landed $3\sigma$ away, yellow is $2\sigma$, and green is $1\sigma$. The arrows indicate in which direction the deviation occurred, i.e., an energy decrease or increase.

\subsection{Mock Model Deployment}

Per the experimentation workflow in \hyperlink{figure.12}{Figure 12}, the final step is to save the model's parameters (state) to a \path{.pth} file. Within this file is the full "raw" state of the learned GPyTorch model parameters. Saving this to a file allows one to simply load the model's state back into an ExactGP module and perform inference without any further training needed. To prepare the GPyTorch model for a prototype deployment in CLEMAP's environment and infrastructure, the focus will be on developing a docker container for the \textit{inference} phase. As \hyperlink{figure.18}{Figure 18} shows, this consists only of the ExactGP module, model state, and kernel and utilities.

\subsection{Assumptions and Limitations of Models}

One of the assumptions of the models is the benchmark reporting period. Ideally, one should have a longer time period to analyze and to choose this period from. Indeed, most of the related work in \hyperlink{section.2}{Section 2} had access to several months of data. The work conducted in this thesis was meant to be an exploration / proof of feasibility, and therefore access to more data was limited. A longer time series allows for a wider range of production processes and periodicity's to be modeled than the current production week implemented in this thesis.

A limitation of the current baseline model implementation is that it does not take into account other covariates or production processes. Rather, it is only an extrapolation based on the past. For example, a meeting with CLEMAP's client production leader on 12.05.2022 had stated the company plans the next week's production on the Thursday before. Therefore, there is the possibility to include the production as a covariate for some of the models. However, this information came too late in this thesis to incorporate. Furthermore, after speaking with the production leader, it is clear the production processes are complex and can vary from order to order. The heterogeneous production environment makes it false positives more likely when changing production environments are not taken into account.
