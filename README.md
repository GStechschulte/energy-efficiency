## Open Datasets

**Production / Manufacturing** (Industry 4.0)

- High Resolution Industrial Production Energy (HIPE) data set that contains smart meter readings of ten machines and the main terminal of a power electronics production plant over three months
    - via [KIT - HIPE Data](https://www.energystatusdata.kit.edu/hipe.php) 
    - via [KIT - HIPE Feature Data Set](https://www.energystatusdata.kit.edu/hipe-features.php)

- Industrial Machines for Electrical Load Disaggregation - Contains individual heavy-machinery data and aggregate energy consumption from the Brazilian industrial sector
    - via [Industrial Machines Dataset for Electrical Load Disaggregation | IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/industrial-machines-dataset-electrical-load-disaggregation)

- Smart Energy Data from Aachen / Cologne Smart Factory - This data set provides energy consumption profiles of a smart factory and four of its machines at FINESCE [trial site Aachen / Cologne](http://www finesce.eu/Trial_Site_Aachen.html)
    — via [Smart Energy Data: Aachen/ Cologne Smart Factory - Datasets - FIWARE Lab Data Portal](https://data.lab.fiware.org/dataset/smart_energy_data-_aachen__cologne_smart_factory)


- Development of Industrial IoT System for Anomoly Detection in Smart Factories
    - Rather than focusing on equipment status, we focus on identifying factors such as workers’ behavior and working conditions using IoT sensors to improve quality and productivity.
