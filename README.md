## Open Datasets

**Production / Manufacturing** (Industry 4.0)

- High Resolution Industrial Production Energy (HIPE) data set contains smart meter readings of ten machines and the main terminal of a power electronics production plant over three months
    - via [KIT - HIPE Data](https://www.energystatusdata.kit.edu/hipe.php) 
    - via [KIT - HIPE Feature Data Set](https://www.energystatusdata.kit.edu/hipe-features.php)

- Development of Industrial IoT System for Anomoly Detection in Smart Factories
    - Rather than focusing on equipment status, we focus on identifying factors such as workers’ behavior and working conditions using IoT sensors to improve quality and productivity.

**Mobility**

- One year half hourly profiles of demand, PV generation, and EV charging for a household in London, UK
    - via [One-year half-hourly profiles of demand, PV generation, and EV charging for a household in London, UK | IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/one-year-half-hourly-profiles-demand-pv-generation-and-ev-charging-household-london-uk) 


**Smart Community**

- Open power source dataset (OPSD) - contains measured time series data for several small businesses and residential households relevant for household- or low-voltage-level power system modeling. The data includes solar power generation as well as electricity consumption (load) in a resolution up to single device consumption
