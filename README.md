Energy efficiency in industry is very important to contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions. The use of sensors to monitor the energy consumption **and** the state of operation of industrial equipment can help to evaluate the efficiency, **and** to identify equipment or processes where energy is “wasted”. The objective of this work is to help improve energy efficiency by extracting information from sensors that measure the energy consumption of industrial equipment

Stage 1.) Getting an overview of methods available in the literature, identification of open data sets and software tools, and popular business models

Stage 2.) Select specific industrial applications that show the larger potential for reduction of CO2 emissions. On this basis, the main objective is then to develop algorithms and metrics to evaluate energy efficiency in specific datasets representative to the selected industrial applications

Stage 3.) Deploy your models and analyses on a cloud platform to evaluate them real-time on new data (streaming)
